## Divless-HTML
**Divless, nameless close tag HTML** allows you to write HTML tag quickly for sandboxing activity.

```html
Basic tag writing
[ ]        is equal to     <div></div>
[table ]   is equal to     <table></table>

Basic attributes and content writing
[ .my-class]
[ @element-id]
[ {background:red}]
[ "This is the content of the div"]
[
  This is also content, but without quotes and extra spaces for readability
]

Advanced writing
[ .class-1 @element-id .class-2 {background:red} contenteditable="true" "This is the content" .class-3 {padding:8px}]
```
